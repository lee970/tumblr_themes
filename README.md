# tumblr themes #
- themes are coded using html, css, and tumblr's custom theme documentation (will incorporate javascript in the future)
- this is a personal project I recently started for several reasons:
  - to practice coding in html, css, and javascript
  - to familiarize myself with web development skills
  - to practice designing functional user interfaces
  - to practice documenting my code for the purpose of releasing it for others to use
  - to provide myself with a tracking method for my own progress - namely to see the improvements made between themes I created using only self-taught knowledge, and themes I will eventually create/recreate after taking a web development course (a tech elective I will be taking in fall 2017)
